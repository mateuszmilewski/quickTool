# quickTool
This is an repo for quick tool - prototype of coverage file for psa and thier systems


First commit from version 0.8

This is still an prototype version of the tool - to be implemented and be more inline with current implementation of Fire Flake...

Also idea to have in common data from corail, maestro and even mgo and maybe some custom external excel files.
